# OC_EFI_NVMeFix.KEXT-v.109
Need to solve compatibility issue with Corsair NVMe.  -   OC 0.7.7
hello I am looking for support or much better the solution ;). I'm following NVmeFix @ acidanthera cause i bought NvMe drive Corsair MP400, in late october and
since then, my hack start freezing, having multiple KP. Actually It worked fine for a week or so and then it started.
I had other similar drive, but never had issues, so at first I thought it wasn't NvME, mostly because a coincident event misleaded me. 
Just lately I found out that 3rd party NVME can cause KP and issues, and that it was just luck that it didn't happen before.
A few days ago, it fried. Since it was so new I just sent it back claiming a random, inexplicable malfunction and they replaced it with a brand new one
(i know, please don't judge me!).
I tried to follow acidanthera indication as he posted, even looked for a  firmware upgrade that I heard could help but so far no good news. FW was updated.
I'm pretty scared to fry this one too.
